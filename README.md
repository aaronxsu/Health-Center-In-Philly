# Health Centers in Philly
To use this app: http://aaronxsu.github.io/Health-Center-In-Philly/

### Project
We're producing a simple map to help people find health centers in the Philadelphia area. Our application has three goals:
* First, we want to know where the health centers are located within the zip codes from 19140 to 19149 (inclusive).
* Second, we'd like to provide users with the ability to export our data in a simplified CSV format. We can provide this to them in console printouts.
* Some health centers offer dental services as well. They are plotted onto the map with special icons.
